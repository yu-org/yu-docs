### Process overview
![image](yu_flow_chart.png)  

When a transaction is initiated from the client to the chain, it will first be checked by `txpool`, and only after the check is passed will it be put into the transaction pool and broadcast to other blockchain nodes.
Receive transactions broadcast from other nodes in the P2P network, and put them into `txpool` after checking (no longer broadcast) 

`land` runs, starts generating blocks, and performs a series of processing on blocks: including mining blocks, broadcasting, validating blocks from other nodes, executing intra-block transactions, storing blocks on the chain, etc. . During this process
There are so many things that can be freely controlled, and you can use it to implement any consensus algorithm, sharding method, block time, package transaction method, choose when to execute transactions, etc. you want. with `blockchain`,
The interaction of `yudb`, `state` is also in this process.


After each block goes through all the custom `tripod` logic in `land`, it will enter the next block stage, generate the next block and process it, and the cycle goes on and on.
