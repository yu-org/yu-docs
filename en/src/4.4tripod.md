# Tripod  
#### Description
`tripod` is the core of the entire yu framework, and developers define their own business logic by implementing its interface. It consists of three parts:  
1.  Custom block verification rules and transaction checking logic.   
2.  Control the life cycle of blocks to achieve deep customization development. The life cycle has four phases: `initChain`, `startBlock`, `endBlock`, `finalizeBlock`. where only `initChain`
    It is called only at the time of the genesis block, and the last three are called every block. (Personalized consensus algorithms can be implemented with the block life cycle)   
3. Customize `Transaction`(Execution), `Query`(Query) and `P2P Request Handling` (p2pHandler) 
#### Interface  
Code is [here](https://github.com/yu-org/yu/blob/master/core/tripod/tripod.go)  

```go
func GetTripodMeta() *TripodMeta
func Name() string
func SetChainEnv(env *ChainEnv)
```
`GetTripodMeta()` returns the metadata for a `tripod`, which is defined in [here. ](https://github.com/yu-org/yu/blob/master/core/tripod/tripod_meta.go)
This metadata includes a list of `Execution` and `Query`.  
`Name()` returns the name of `tripod`。  
`SetChainEnv(*ChainEnv)` loads `ChainEnv` into `tripod`, which is convenient for subsequent calls. (`ChainEnv` is introduced in [context and chainEnv](5.2context与chainEnv.md))

## 
```go
func CheckTxn(*SignedTxn) error
func VerifyBlock(block *CompactBlock) bool
``` 
`checkTxn()` is a developer-defined transaction check logic. As mentioned in the previous chapter, when an external transaction is inserted into `txpool`, the two steps of `BaseChack` and `TripodsCheck` will be executed.
And `TripodsCheck` is defined here, each `tripod` can define its own transaction check logic.    

`VerifyBlock()` is a developer-defined block verification logic. Every time the blockchain receives a block from external broadcast, it needs to be verified before it can be processed. Different chains have different verifications for blocks. test method, so
Developers can customize the validation logic by themselves. Each `tripod` can define its own transaction checking logic.

##  
```go
func InitChain() error
func StartBlock(block *CompactBlock) (needBroadcast bool, err error)
func EndBlock(block *CompactBlock) error
func FinalizeBlock(block *CompactBlock) error
```  
`InitChain()` will only be called once when the blockchain is started, and it is specially used to define and process the `genesis block`.  
`StartBlock()` defines the logic of the stage when the block is generated, and needs to return a `needBroadcast` return value of type `bool` to tell the framework whether the block needs to be broadcast. Generally, if it is a locally mined block, it needs to be broadcast, if it is from other nodes
The acquired block does not need to be broadcast.    
`EndBlock()` defines the logic at the end of the block, where the transaction is generally executed and the block is stored in the blockchain.     
`FinalizeBlock()` defines the logic of the block's `finalize phase` (i.e. final consensus). If the blockchain is a `finalize type chain`, you need to customize this part of the logic, otherwise it is not necessary.
