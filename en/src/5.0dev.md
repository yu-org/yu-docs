# Development Manual

This chapter will go into the details of how to develop a blockchain with `yu`. i.e. how to build your own `tripod`.  

The default path of the configuration file is `yu_conf/kernel.toml`. If you need to configure it separately, please use `-k` to specify the path of the configuration file.  
Of course, if you don't want to configure the file yourself, you can also use `-dc` to enable the system default configuration. However, it should be noted that the default configuration of the system does not connect to any `bootnodes`.
