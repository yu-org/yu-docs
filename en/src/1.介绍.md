# Introduce

Yu is an easy-to-use and highly customizable blockchain framework developed in golang. 
Most of the existing blockchains (Public Blockchain and Consortium Blockchain) can be developed with yu.

### Why do this?
The current blockchain framework either has a high threshold for getting started, or the degree of customization is very low, or the community is inactive and has stopped maintenance. So I developed it myself
This blockchain framework. The purpose is to allow developers to get started with the core of blockchain development more easily, quickly and deeply.




### What functions can Yu customize  

- Customized consensus algorithms, including but not limited to pow, pos, poa, pbft, etc.  
- Custom block verification logic, transaction verification logic, rules for packaging transactions from the transaction pool.
- Insert custom actions at various stages of the block generation cycle, including controlling when transactions are executed.
- Custom on-chain transactions (ie Execution, called transactions in Ethereum) and queries  
- Custom chain structure (including fork logic) and transaction pool logic
- Can be developed in multiple programming languages (not yet finished)
