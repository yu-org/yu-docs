# Config File  
The format of the yu configuration file is `.toml`.  
The configuration content is divided into the following partsï¼Œ code is [here](https://github.com/yu-org/yu/blob/master/config/config.go)


- Node Config  
- each Component Config  
- P2P Config


The default configuration file path for `yu` is `yu_conf/kernel.toml`. Of course, if you don't want to fill in the configuration file manually, you can also enable the command line as in [Quick Start] (2. Quick Start.md)
`-dc=true` to take advantage of the default configuration. The source address of the default configuration is [here](https://github.com/yu-org/yu/blob/master/config/default.go)
